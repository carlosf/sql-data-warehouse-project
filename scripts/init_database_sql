-- Create Database 'DataWarehouse'
/*

Create Database and Schemas

Script Purpose:
    This creates a new database called 'DataWarehouse' after checking if it already exists.
    If the database exists, it is dropped and recreated.  Additionally, the script sets up three schemas
    within the database: 'bronze', 'silver', and 'gold''.

WARNING:
    Running this script will drop the entire ''DataWarehouse'database if it exists.
    All data in the database will be permanently deleted.  Proceed with caution
    and ensure you have proper backups before running this script.
